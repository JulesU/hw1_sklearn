# Data sources
Folder structure with cookiecutter and git
Version control 
EDA

# Data prep

Categorize feature types 
Create separate columns of numeric and categorical variables

# Modeling and analysis
Logistic regression models :

Model 0: The null model
Model 1: Ridge regression with C=1.0  
Model 2: Lasso regression with C=1.0  
Model 3: Lasso regression with C=0.01
Model 4: Lasso regression with optimal C value
Task 5 - Simple decision tree
Little error exploration - Challenge

# Worklow
